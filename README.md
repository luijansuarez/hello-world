# hello-world
I'm on a journey to learn how to code and make something great out of it.

Hello everyone, my name is Luis. I'm from Venezuela, studied civil engineering but work in marketing.
I've strated to learn to code since I want to go back to engineering but in a different branch and hope GitHub will help me. Been learning through codecademy and youtube. Looking foward to this new experience.
